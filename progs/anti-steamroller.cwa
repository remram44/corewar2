mov $1 #-3 ; put the bait DAT 1
ife $1 #-4 ; check presence of the bait
jmp #-1    ; if present, keep checking
mov $0 #-4 ; if overwritten, bomb with DAT 0 to kill the steamroller
mov $0 #-5 ;     that was probably responsible for that
mov $0 #-6 ; bomb multiple times because we might have detected with a delay
mov $0 #-7 ;     since detection uses two instructions, and because of FORKs
mov $0 #-8 ;     the roller can be moving slowly
jmp #-8    ; then go back to the start (put a new bait)
